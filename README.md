This project analyzes how public discourse on immigration shifted between the 2020 and 2024 U.S. presidential debates using YouTube comment data. After collecting and cleaning 1,816 comments with an adapted YouTube API script, I applied VADER sentiment analysis and TF–IDF to compare emotional tone and dominant topics across the two years. Results show a clear move from policy- and humanitarian-focused discussion in 2020 toward more negative, adversarial, and candidate-centered language in 2024. The findings illustrate how online debate commentary has become increasingly polarized and less policy-substantive over time.
